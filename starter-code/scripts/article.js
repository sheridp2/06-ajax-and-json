// REVIEW: Instead of a global `articles = []` array, let's track this list of all articles directly on the
// constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype. In JavaScript, functions are themselves
// objects, which means we can add properties/values to them at any time. In this case, we have
// a key/value pair to track, that relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on
// the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.

// REVIEW: There are some other functions that also relate to articles across the board, rather than
// just single instances. Object-oriented programming would call these "class-level" functions,
// that are relevant to the entire "class" of objects that are Articles.

// REVIEW: This function will take the rawData, how ever it is provided,
// and use it to instantiate all the articles. This code is moved from elsewhere, and
// encapsulated in a simply-named function for clarity.
